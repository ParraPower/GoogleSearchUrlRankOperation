Hello all,

This is a very simple MVC application.

Using Google's Custom Search Engine API, the intention of this program:

	1. Grab search criteria entered by user in search form

	2. Enter search terms entered by user into Google's Custom Search API

	3. Get back results 
	
	4. Compare each result returned against the url specified by the User.

	5. Display matches on next page


NOTE: Google API limits Free use of it to 100 queries per day. :(
	  Site will continously emit 0 results returned when this happens. :(
